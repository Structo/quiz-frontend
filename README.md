## Challenge 1
Create a React component to do the following:
- Mutiple selection dropdown
- Which can be searchable (filterable) via user text input (See screenshots below)
- You can preload array of countries as the dropdown values
- Note: You do not need to follow the aethetic of the samples below.



Please share the solution via a public git repository

## Challenge 2
Note: You do not need to code anything. You can describe and explain in words. 

You are now building an inventory management web application which has the following features:
- This app has 2 types of users (have different access priviledges to different page and functions in the app), say `basic` and `admin` users.
- The home page shows a list of items (say shoes) which comes in 3 types (`sandal`, `highheel`, and `sport`), where the items can be filtered by type, and other properties.
- `basic` users have read-only access to the home page.
- `admin` users have full access and can add/edit the list items.
- There's also a users page which `admin` users have access to. This page allows adding/editing of access privileges.
- Data are being served via authenticated RESTful API.

Please propose the followings:
- Any 3rd party libraries/tools you would use
- Architecture (framework, file structure, etc)
- How to maximize code reusability
- How to segregate user access based on user privilege (eg: How to restrict access of `basic` user on customer's information)
- Testing method used.
- __Bonus__: How would you deploy the app for production.
